# OperatingPlatforms
Portfolio for O.P.

  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client was The Gaming Room, and they wanted to expand their game Draw It or Lose It from Android to a web-based app. They needed it to work on many devices, support multiple players, and stay secure and fast.

  What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I clearly explained the system design and matched it to what the client needed. The operating system comparison was also well-organized and helpful for making decisions.

  What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Writing the design document helped me plan before coding. It made the coding process easier because I had a clear idea of what the software needed to do.

  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would improve the Domain Model section by making it easier to read and improving the diagram. At the moment it is small and not the right image type so it is hard to read. This would help others understand how the classes are connected.

  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I used the client’s needs to choose tools and design features that matched their goals. Considering user needs is important so the final product is useful and easy to use.

  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I started with the requirements and chose tools that fit the project. Next time, I’ll use more diagrams and feedback to improve the design early on.
